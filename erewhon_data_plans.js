Erewhon Mobile charges cellular customers a rate based on the total amount of data used by a customer in the billing period. For simplicity, customers are charge based on which range their total data usage falls within. Note, it is not a cumulative charge; your program will figure out which single range the usage falls into, then calculate the cost based on that rangeâ€™s cost.
